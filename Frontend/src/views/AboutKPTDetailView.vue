        </h1>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-6">
          The Kampong Thom Orphanage is a community-driven initiative located in the heart of Cambodia. Our mission is to provide a loving home, quality education, and emotional support to children who have lost one or both parents or come from families in extreme poverty.
        </p>
        <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-8">
          Founded in 2002 as part of the Boreykomar Kampong Thom initiative, the orphanage was established in response to the rising number of children left vulnerable due to poverty, illness, and social instability. It has grown from a small local shelter to a full-support community that nurtures over 80 children through care, education, and empowerment.

        <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mb-4">
          The Kampong Thom Orphanage was founded by a group of local educators and monks who believed that no child should be left behind. With support from community leaders and international donors, the orphanage began as a small effort and has evolved into a model of sustainable child care and community engagement in Cambodia.
